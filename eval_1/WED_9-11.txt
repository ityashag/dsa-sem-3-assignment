ODD Systems:
Q1. You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N. Analyse the complexity also.

Eg: 5 1 3 8 2 
ans is 1+2 = 3


Q2. discuss time and space complexity

Display()
{
 x=32, n, i,j,k;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    for(j=0;j<n;j++)
    {
        if(!(x%6))
            break;
	continue;
        for(k=0;k<n;k++)
        {
            printf("%d  ",x);
            break;
        }

} }
return 0;

}




Even Systems:

Q1. There are N horses in the stable. The skill of the horse i is represented by an integer S[i]. The Chef needs to pick 2 horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. Your task is to help him do this and report the minimum difference that is possible between 2 horses in the race.Analyse the complexity also.

eg: 4 9 1 32 13
ans is 3

Q2. discuss time and space complexity

Display()
{
 x=32, n, i,j,k;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
    for(j=0;j<n;j++)
    {
        if((x%6))
            break;
	continue;
        for(k=0;k<n;k++)
        {
            printf("%d  ",x);
            break;
        }

} }
return 0;
